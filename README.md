This is a silly project generating audio video by reading a raw data from a file.
The sequence usually reflects the pattern of the file. If most of the screen is black with little regular glitches, so the file contain a lot of `00` and few data at regular interval.

The algorithm deciding to switch to color is subject to change to get something more impactful. The goal would be to generate a beautiful/crazy sequence from any file. It needs improvement for sure.

The best so far is to use mp4 files. Just be careful to not put a big one. It might crash.
